# ULTRASKINS GC
Fixing up tonys ultraskins to work without UMM, this project is forked from that

# what do
UltraSkins is a mod that allows you to change the textures of your arms and the guns

# Install notes 
After installing you will need to run the game once before the mod will work
this will generate the files needed for the mod to function
PLEASE BACKUP YOUR CUSTOM SKINS BEFORE UPDATING OR UNINSTALLING

## IMPORTANT NOTE
after a new skin is selected swap your gun once and change your arm once to finish the update
skinsfolder should go in the folder where the dll is located

r2modman users should be "AppData\Roaming\r2modmanPlus-local\ULTRAKILL\profiles\\\*profilename\*\BepInEx\plugins\bobthecorn-ULTRASKINS_GC\"

steam users should be in "steamapps\common\ULTRAKILL\BepInEx\plugins\UltraSkins"

inside you directory create a folder (name it whatever) and put the skin files in that, (OG-SKINS has been provided as an example of what it should look like)

## so whats different and what should i know
1. removed umm as the manager is outdated, everything should still work
2. custom colors using the in game color customizer might be a bit funky lookin
3. jackhammer emissive is untested, feel free to try and add one, i have no idea if it will work, i will include it later
